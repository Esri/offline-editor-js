How to use the edit library
===========================

##`edit` library

The `edit` library allows a developer to extend a feature layer with offline editing support. You can combine this functionality with offline tiles. For a complete list of features consult the [OfflineFeaturesManager API doc](offlinefeaturesmanager.md).

**Step 1** Include `offline.min.js`, `offline-tiles-basic-min.js` and `offline-edit-min.js` in your app's require contstructor. Be sure to include `ofline.mins.js` which is a 3rd party library for detecting if the browser is online or offline. 

The pattern for how we include the tiles and edit library within the `require` statement is called generic script injection. Note that we do assign any of the editing or tile libraries an alias name. For example, we specified the mobile path "esri/map" and we gave it an alias called "Map." But, we did not do the equivalent for `offline-tiles-based-min.js` or `offline-edit-min.js`.

```html	
	<script src="../vendor/offline/offline.min.js"></script>
	<script>
	require([
		"esri/map", 
		"..dist/offline-tiles-basic-min.js",
		"..dist/offline-edit-min.js",
		function(Map)
	{
		...
	});
```

You can also refer to the offline-editor-js within a `define` statement using the following pattern for importing the library. Note you can leave off the `.js` from the module identifier, for example:

```js

	define(["..dist/offline-edit-min"],function(){
		...
	})

```

**Step 2** Once your map is created (either using new Map() or using esriUtils.createMap(webmapid,...), you create a new OfflineFeaturesManager instance and starting assigning events listeners to tie the library into your user interface:

```js
		
		var offlineFeaturesManager = new O.esri.Edit.OfflineFeaturesManager();
		// OPTIONAL - you can change the name of the database
		// offlineFeaturesManager.DBNAME = "FIELD_SURVEY3";
		// OPTIONAL - you can change the name of the unique identifier used by the feature service. Default is "objectid".
		// offlineFeaturesManager.UID = "GlobalID";
		offlineFeaturesManager.on(offlineFeaturesManager.events.EDITS_ENQUEUED, updateStatus);
updateStatus);
		offlineFeaturesManager.on(offlineFeaturesManager.events.ALL_EDITS_SENT, updateStatus);		              
		offlineFeaturesManager.on(offlineFeaturesManager.events.EDITS_SENT_ERROR, handleEditsSentError);
		
```		

NOTE: You can also monitor standard ArcGIS API for JavaScript layer events using the typical pattern such as:

```js

      	offlineFeatureLayer.on("edits-complete", handleEditsComplete);

```

**Step 3** Set a listener for the `layers-add-result` event. Then, add the feature layer to the map just like you normally would.

**IMPORTANT:** The library currently only works offline when the `mode` is set to `FeatureLayer.MODE_SNAPSHOT`:

```js
	
	map.on('layers-add-result', initEditor);
	
	var fsUrl = "http://services2.arcgis.com/CQWCKwrSm5dkM28A/arcgis/rest/services/Military/FeatureServer/1";

    var layer1 = new FeatureLayer(fsUrl, {
		mode: FeatureLayer.MODE_SNAPSHOT,
		outFields: ['*']
	});

	map.addLayers(featureLayers);
	
```

**Step 4** After the `layers-add-result` event fires extend the feature layer using the `extend()` method. Optionally, if you are building a fully offline app then you will also need to set the `dataStore` property in the constructor.

```js
		
		function initEditor(evt)
		{
			// OPTIONAL - for fully offline use you can store a data object
			// var options = {};
            // options.graphics = JSON.stringify(layer1.toJson());
            // options.zoom = map.getZoom();
            
			offlineFeaturesManager.extend(layer1,function(success,error){
				if(success){
					console.log("layer1 has been extended for offline use.");
				}
			}/*, dataStore */);
		}			
		
```

The `dataStore` property is an object that is used to store any data related to your app that will assist in restoring it and any feature layers after a full offline browser restart. The `dataStore` object has one reserved key and that is `id`. If you overwrite the `id` key the application will fail to update the `dataStore` object correctly. Here is an example of one possible `dataStore` object:

```js

	var dataStore = {
		"featureLayerJSON": featureLayer.toJson(),
		"zoom": map.getZoom(),
		"centerPt": (map.extent.getCenter()).toJson()
	}

```

You can then retrieve this data after an offline restart by using the following pattern:

```js

	featureLayer.getFeatureLayerJSONDataStore(function(success, dataStore){
		if(success){
			myFeatureLayer = new 
				FeatureLayer(JSON.parse(dataStore.featureLayerCollection),{
            	mode: FeatureLayer.MODE_SNAPSHOT,
               	outFields: ["GlobalID","BSID","ROUTES","STOPNAME"]
           	});
		}
	});


```

**Step 5** Once a layer has been extended the offline library will enable it with new methods. Here are a few examples that include code snippets of how to take advantage of some of the library's methods. You can also use a combination of methods from `editsStore` and `offlineFeaturesManager`.

####offlineFeaturesManager.proxyPath
By default, the library assumes you are using a CORS-enabled Feature Service. All ArcGIS Online Feature Services are CORS-enabled. If you are hosting your own service and it is not CORS-enabled, then you will need to set this path. More information on downloading and using ArcGIS proxies can be found here: [https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/jshelp/ags_proxy.html](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/jshelp/ags_proxy.html)

Here's one example:

```js

	offlineFeaturesManager.proxyPath = "../your-local-proxy-directory/proxy.php";

```

####offlineFeaturesManager.goOffline()
Force the library to go offline. Once this condition is set, then any offline edits will be cached locally.

```js
		function goOffline()
		{
			offlineFeaturesManager.goOffline();
			//TO-DO
		}
```

####offlineFeaturesManager.goOnline()
Force the library to return to an online condition. If there are pending edits, the library will attempt to sync them.

```js
		function goOnline()
		{			
			offlineFeaturesManager.goOnline(function(success,results)
			{
				if(success){
				    //Modify user inteface depending on success/failure
				}				
			});
		}
```

It's important to note that the `results` object contains all the necessary information about successes and failures that may have occurred during the online resync process. Here is a description of what's inside. The `features.responses` object contains information on features sync. The `attachments.uploadResponses` contain information on attachments sync. And, the `attachments.dbResponses` contains information on whether or not any attachment that was successfully sync'd was deleted from the local database. 

```js

resultsObject = {
    features:{
        success : boolean,
        responses : responses
    },
    attachments:{
        success : boolean,
        uploadResponses : uploadResponses,
        dbResponses : dbResponses 
    }
}

```


####offlineFeaturesManager.getOnlineStatus()
Within your application you can manually check online status and then update your user interface. By using a switch/case statement you can check against three enums that indicate if the library thinks it is offline, online or in the process of reconnecting.

```js		
			
			switch( offlineFeaturesManager.getOnlineStatus() )
			{
				case offlineFeaturesManager.OFFLINE:
					node.innerHTML = "<i class='fa fa-chain-broken'></i> offline";
					domClass.add(node, "offline");
					break;
				case offlineFeaturesManager.ONLINE:
					node.innerHTML = "<i class='fa fa-link'></i> online";
					domClass.add(node, "online");
					break;
				case offlineFeaturesManager.RECONNECTING:
					node.innerHTML = "<i class='fa fa-cog fa-spin'></i> reconnecting";
					domClass.add(node, "reconnecting");
					break;
			}
		
```

####featureLayer.pendingEditsCount(callback)
You can check if there are any edits pending. If there are edits then you can iterate `editsStore.retrieveEditsQueue()` and convert the edits to a readable format via `offlineFeaturesManager.getReadableEdit(edit)`.
		
```js
	
	// Simply get a count
	featureLayer.pendingEditsCount(function(count){
		console.log("There are " + count + " edits pending");
	})		
	
	// Or retrieve all pending edits
	featureLayer.getAllEditsArray(function(success,editsArray){
	 	if(success && editsArray.length > 0){
	 		editsArray.forEach(function(edit){
	 			console.log("Pending edit: " + JSON.stringify(edit));
	 		});
	 	}
	})
			
```
