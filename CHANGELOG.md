# offline-editor-js - Changelog

## Version 2.7

This release focused on improving the handling of attachments. Has breaking changes.

** Enhancements **
* Added a new sample attachments-editor-secure.html to demonstrate the pattern for working with secure feature services and attachments.
* Closes #286 - support for secure services (HTTPS) when working with attachments
* Closes #305 - Support both ADD and UPDATE attachment. 
* Closes #306 - removes createObjectURL functionality from attachmentsStore. This allows for attachments to be used in full offline scenarios.
* Closes #318 - added OfflineFeaturesManager.ATTACHMENTS_DB_NAME and ATTACHMENTS_DB_OBJECSTORE_NAME.
* Closes #321 - switch offlineFeaturesManager unit test to a different feature service that's attachments enabled.
* Closes #322 - rewrite offlineAttachmentsSpec.
* Closes #324 - attachmentsStore._readFile() can indicate false positives.
* Closes #325 - support DELETE an existing attachment.
* Closes #328 - add layer.resestAttachmentsDatabase().
* Closes #329 - add layer.getAttachmentsUsage().

** Breaking Changes **
* attachmentsStore.DB_NAME has been renamed to attachmentsStore.dbName to be consistent with editStore.
* attachmentsStore.OBJECTSTORE_NAME has been renamed to attachmentsStore.objectStoreName to be consistent with editStore.
* Added use of the browser's [FormData() API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) along with `FormData.append`. This may cause 
attachment support to break in certain older browsers. This is a courtesy heads-up because as a rule this library only
supports the latest version of Chrome, Firefox and Safari. 

## Version 2.6 - April 9, 2015

Recommended update. No breaking changes. 

**Bug Fixes**

* Closes #308 - resetLimitedPhantomGraphicsQueue failing. Could cause fatal errors.

**Updates**

* Closes #304 - preserve version number in minified builds
* Closes #307 - package.json updated devDependencies
* Updated editsStoreSpec2 to accommodate the fix for #308
* jshint updates:
    * jshint now working for /edit directory. Initial step towards piping all files thru jshint!
    * jshint fix to attachmentsStore.js - moved "use strict" into function
    * jshint fix to OfflineEditNS.js - removed "use strict" & added jshint exception
    * Many jshint fixes in offlineFeaturesManager.js
    * jshint fix to .jshintrc
* Deleted editsStore_old.js

## Version 2.5.1 - April 7, 2015 

Closes #301 - OfflineFeaturesManager failed on _validateFeature during an attachment ADD operation.

## Version 2.5.0.2 - April 2, 2015

Minor doc update. Clarification in OfflineFeaturesManager on requiring `mode` be set to `FeatureLayer.MODE_SNAPSHOT`.

## Version 2.5.0.1 - April 1, 2015

Minor doc update. Added references to attachments documentation. Misc. clarifications.

## Version 2.5 - March 27, 2015

v2.5 focused on updating OfflineFeaturesManager from using localStorage to IndexedDB. Additional information is available in the [API Doc](https://github.com/Esri/offline-editor-js/blob/master/doc/offlinefeaturesmanager.md). Feature edit storage capabilities have been increased from 5 MBs to approximately 50 - 100 MBs or more, and the changes made allow for additional functionality and capabilities to be implemented that weren't possible under the previous architecture.**

Closes #292, #289, #285, #281, #280, #275, #261

**BREAKING CHANGES:** In order to accomplish the v2.5 update the following **breaking** changes were made. All common `EditStore` functionality was migrated to the FeatureLayer so that under most circumstances there is no need to use or access the `EditStore` library directly anymore. In fact, as of v2.5 accessing it directly is discouraged. 

* `OfflineFeatureManager.getReadableEdit()` deprecated. Use `featureLayer.getAllEditsArray()`.
* `editsStore.hasPendingEdits()` deprecated. Use `featureLayer.pendingEdits()`.
* `editsStore.retrieveEditsQueue()` deprecated. Use `featureLayer.getAllEditsArray()`.
* `editsStore.getEditsStoreSizeBytes()` deprecated. Use `featureLayer.getUsage()`.
* `editsStore.getLocalStorageSizeBytes()` deprecated. Use `featureLayer.getUsage()`.

**New Functionality in OfflineFeatureManager**

* `OfflineFeaturesManager.DB_NAME`. Allows you to set the database name of the edits library.
* `OfflineFeaturesManager.DB_OBJECTSTORE_NAME`. Set an internal object store within the database that allows access to a set of data. 
* `OfflineFeaturesManager.DB_UID`. **IMPORTANT**. This tells the database which `id` to use as a unique identifier for each feature service. 
* `OfflineFeaturesManager.events.EDITS_SENT`. **Updated**. Now this event is only triggered when an edit is synced with the server while online.
* `OfflineFeaturesManager.events.EDITS_SENT_ERROR`. Indicates there was an error when syncing with the server. If there was an error, the edit will remain in the database.
* `OfflineFeaturesManager.events.EDITS_ENQUEUED_ERROR`. Indicates an error occurred while trying to store an edit in offline mode. 

**New Functionality in FeatureLayer** When you use `OfflineFeatureManager.extend()` to extend a feature layer it will be enabled with the following new functionality:

* `featureLayer.resetDatabase()`. Full database reset.
* `featureLayer.pendingEditsCount()`. Returns the number of pending edits.
* `featureLayer.getUsage()`. Returns the approximate size of the database and number of edits.
* `featureLayer.getPhantomGraphicsArray()`. Used with offline browser restarts. Returns an array of phantom graphics. Complimentary to `featureLayer.getPhantomLayerGraphics()`.
* `featureLayer.getAllEditsArray()`. Returns an array of all edits stored in the database.
* `featureLayer.getFeatureLayerJSON()`. A helper function for retrieving a feature layers JSON using the REST `f=json` parameter. Note you can also retrieve feature layer JSON using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript's `featureLayer.toJson()` method.
* `featureLayer.setFeatureLayerJSONDataStore()`. Sets or updates the optional feature layer storage object. You can also set the dataStore using the `OfflineFeatureManager` constructor's `dataStore` property.
* `featureLayer.getFeatureLayerJSONDataStore()`. Retrieves the optional feature layer storage object.
* `featureLayer.convertFeatureGraphicsToJSON()`. Helper function that converts an array of graphics to a JSON string.

** Footnote on browser storage capabilities. The amount of storage varies from device to device. It depends on multiple factors related to the browser including how much memory space the browser has consumed, how large the browser cache has grown, how many other tabs may be open, and how much memory other applications are already consuming.

## Version 2.4 - Nov 26, 2014
- Closes #274 phantom symbols not working correctly
	- Updated offlineFeaturesManager.js
	- Updated API docs to reflect new functionality.
- Updated appcache-features.html sample to incorporate new functionality.

- Added getPhantomLayerGraphics() - for use with offline browser restarts. Allows you to get a JSON copy of the current phantom graphics layers so that you can save it to a local database such as localStorage.

Breaking changes: none

## Version 2.0 - Sep 8, 2014

Version 2.0 involves many changes. Please read the following carefully when upgrading from v1.x to v2.0.

Breaking Changes:

- Provides a single, concatenated and minified library files in /dist for edit, tiles and tpk. This single library pattern offers a HTTP request/response performance boost by providing libraries of significantly smaller size and only one file to retrieve as compared to making multiple HTTP requests.
- Added a new namespacing for use with all non-AMD JavaScript libraries in the repo.
- Internally refactored all libraries.
- Single, concatenated source library files also available in /dist.
- Updated all samples to ArcGIS API for JavaScript v3.10.
- Concatentation and minification of libraries via a Grunt task.
- All tests updated.
- All samples updated.
- Consolidated duplicate functionality between offlineTilesEnabler.js and OfflineTilesEnablerLayer.js into TilesCore.js. The coding pattern is a bit ackward to access the shared functionality, but the upside is that duplicate functionality only needs to be maintained in a single library.

Overview of the new namespace pattern:

   * `O.esri.Edit` references all offline edit libraries
   * `O.esri.Tiles` references all offline tile libraries
   * `O.esri.TPK` references all TPK libraries
   * `O.esri.zip` a wrapper around Zip.js

Breaking name changes for the following libraries:

   * `offline-edit-min.js` - replaces _OfflineFeaturesManager.js_
   * `offline-tiles-basic-min.js` - _replaces offlineTilesEnabler.js_ 
   * `offline-tiles-advanced-min.js` - replaces _OfflineTilesEnablerLayer.js_
   * `offline-tpk-min.js` - replaces _TPKLayer.js_
   
Breaking name changes for the following Classes:
   
   * `O.esri.Edit.OfflineFeaturesManager()` replaces _OfflineFeaturesManager()_
   * `O.esri.Tiles.OfflineTilesEnabler()` replaces _OfflineTilesEnabler()_
   * `O.esri.Tiles.OfflineTilesEnablerLayer()` replaces _OfflineTilesEnablerLayer()_
   * `O.esri.TPK.TPKLayer()` replaces _TPKLayer()_
   * `O.esri.Edit.EditStore()` replaces _editsStore()_
   * `O.esri.zip` replaces the module _"tpk/zip"_

Breaking changes for the following methods:

   * `O.esri.Edits.EditStore().retrieveEditsQueue()` replaces the formerly private method _editsStore()._retrieveEditsQueue()_

Deprecations:

- Deprecated _restartOfflineFeaturesManager.js_. This functionality has been integrated directly into `OfflineFeaturesManager.js`

## Version 1.x - Various
- Multiple, non-versioned updates 


## Version 1 - Sep 19. 2013

- Initial commit.
